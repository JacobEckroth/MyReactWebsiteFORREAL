# My React Website

This is my react website. It is currently being run from https://jacobeckroth.com

If you want to run it yourself, clone the repository, then run

`npm install`

After you have waited for an hour for all of the packages to install, run `npm run build` to build the production. 

Once you have the build folder, simply type `node Server.js`, and the website will be running on localhost on the port 3001.
